This example also demonstrates how RDF triple stores and newer technologies,
such as distributed ledgers, can be used to create compatibility between
provenance models and other artifacts for scientific workflows. There might be
significant benefits to using distributed ledgers for capturing provenance
because of how easily it enables sharing and search while also mixing in graded
standardization.
